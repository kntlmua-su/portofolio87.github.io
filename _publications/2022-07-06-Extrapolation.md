excerpt: 'In the engineering domain, most systems are composed of the same basic components with diverse compositions. By disentangling the compositionality from the system and embedding it into the model organization, we actually can construct a set of finite "Lego-Block" to predict infinite combinations. We proved that Component-based Machine Learning (CBML) turns the extrapolation problem at the system level into the interpolation problem at the component level in a more flexible and less data-reliance manner.

**Abstract**: <br>
Machine learning (ML) applications often require large datasets, a requirement that can pose a major challenge in fields where data is sparse or inconsistent. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach that combines prior knowledge with data-driven methods to significantly reduce data dependency. This study represents a disentangled system compositionality knowledge by the method of Component-Based Machine Learning (CBML) in the context of energy-efficient building engineering. In this way, CBML incorporates semantic domain knowledge within the structure of a data-driven model. To understand the advantage of CBML, we conducted a case experiment to assess the effectiveness of this knowledge-encoded ML approach in scenarios with sparse data input (1 % - 0.0125 % sampling rate) and several typical ML methods. Our findings reveal three key advantages of this approach over traditional ML methods: 1) It significantly improves the robustness of ML models when dealing with extremely small and inconsistent datasets; 2) It allows for efficient utilization of data from diverse record collections; 3) It can handle incomplete data while maintaining high interpretability and reducing training time. These features offer a promising solution to the challenges associated with deploying data-intensive methods and contribute to more efficient real-world data usage. Additionally, we outline four essential prerequisites to ensure the successful integration of prior knowledge and ML generalization in target scenarios and open-sourced the code and dataset for community reproduction. <br>
